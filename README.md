## React Memory Game

React tutorial, first time using React hooks, useState, useEffect

### `ReactU tutorial`

Following the tutorial found at "https://github.com/react-u/029-build-a-memory-game-using-react-hooks" and on YouTube: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNLT_-mBA0"

### `My changes`

This tutorial was fast so I decided to make a few small additions to make it more like a game instead of an exercise.
